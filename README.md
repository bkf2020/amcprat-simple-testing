# amcprat-simple
A simpler version of AMCPRAT: AMC Practice Tool. The goal is to use
less code, less HTML, and no Javascript. Also, I want a simplier
interface, so it is easier to maintain.

- [x] instead of creating a `stylebutwhite.css` file in every directory, just use one file in `templates/stylebutwhite.css` or something like that
- [x] rename `stylebutwhite.css` to `styleproblems.css`, since it is a more accurate name
- [x] add back `problemset.html` to make checking problemsets much easier
- [x] create c++/python code to generate random webpages for problemsets
- [ ] add tests to make sure problemsets are correct???
