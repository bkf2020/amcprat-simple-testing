	<h2>2020 AMC8 Problem 20</h2>
	<p>A scientist walking through a forest recorded as integers the heights of <img alt="$5$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/9/0/79069377f91364c2f87a64e5f9f562a091c8a6c1.png" style="width: calc(8 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(12 * calc(1em/18));"/> trees standing in a row. She observed that each tree was either twice as tall or half as tall as the one to its right. Unfortunately some of her data was lost when rain fell on her notebook. Her notes are shown below, with blanks indicating the missing numbers. Based on her observations, the scientist was able to reconstruct the lost data. What was the average height of the trees, in meters?
