	<h2>2016 AMC12A Problem 5</h2>
	<p>Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers (for example, <img alt="$2016=13+2003$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/5/0/850bc493353a5591da0e708c4186206ea01a4d79.png" style="vertical-align: -1px; width: calc(136 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(14 * calc(1em/18));"/>). So far, no one has been able to prove that the conjecture is true, and no one has found a counterexample to show that the conjecture is false. What would a counterexample consist of?
