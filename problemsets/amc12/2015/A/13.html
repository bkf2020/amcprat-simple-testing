A team scores 2 points for every game it wins and 1 point for every game it draws. Which of the following is NOT a true statement about the list of 12 scores?
</p><p><img alt="$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{There must be an even number of odd scores.}\\ \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \text{There must be an even number of even scores.}\\ \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \text{There cannot be two scores of }0\text{.}\\ \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \text{The sum of the scores must be at least }100\text{.}\\ \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \text{The highest score must be at least }12\text{.}$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/f/f/2ff63e41107e40bf0223474c343bdf5a4a92eb66.png" style="vertical-align: -4px; width: calc(370 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(96 * calc(1em/18));"/>
