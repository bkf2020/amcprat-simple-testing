	<p>Alice, Bob, and Charlie were on a hike and were wondering how far away the nearest town was. When Alice said, "We are at least 6 miles away," Bob replied, "We are at most 5 miles away." Charlie then remarked, "Actually the nearest town is at most 4 miles away." It turned out that none of the three statements were true. Let <img alt="$d$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/6/a/96ab646de7704969b91c76a214126b45f2b07b25.png" style="width: calc(9 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(12 * calc(1em/18));"/> be the distance in miles to the nearest town. Which of the following intervals is the set of all possible values of <img alt="$d$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/9/6/a/96ab646de7704969b91c76a214126b45f2b07b25.png" style="width: calc(9 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(12 * calc(1em/18));"/>?
