	<h2>2018 AMC8 Problem 13</h2>
	<p>Laila took five math tests, each worth a maximum of 100 points. Laila's score on each test was an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive. Laila received the same score on the first four tests, and she received a higher score on the last test. Her average score on the five tests was 82. How many values are possible for Laila's score on the last test?
