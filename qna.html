		<h2>How do I report an issue with the code, a math problem, etc.?</h2>
		<p>
			Go onto the <a href="https://github.com/bkf2020/amcprat-simple">
			Github repo</a> and open a new issue. Be sure to
			place a link to where you found the problem if it is on
			the website or the location of the code. I plan to open an
			email address soon...
		</p>

		<h2>Can I check the problems for accuracy?</h2>
		<p>Go to <a href="testing.html">the testing page</a> to check the problems.</p>
		
		<h2>The math equations/diagrams are hard to see.</h2>
		<p>Please zoom in on your web browser, so it becomes clearer.</p>

		<h2>Where can I check known issues?</h2>
		<p>View
			<a href="https://github.com/bkf2020/amcprat-simple/issues">
			the issues page on Github.</a>
		</p>


		<h2>What does the code do?</h2>
		<p>First head to the <a href="https://github.com/bkf2020/amcprat-simple">
		Github repo.</a> In the "scraper" directory, "scraper.py" is used to create
		the websites for every problem. In the "problemsets" directory, the problemsets
		are there, and so are all the problems in the system. Lastly, the ".github/workflows" folder contains the workflow that runs a update.py
		program each day to create the problemsets.</p>

		<h2>Have a question that hasn't been answered?</h2>
		<p>Please email [email coming soon] or open an issue on Github.</p>
