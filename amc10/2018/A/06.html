	<p>Sangho uploaded a video to a website where viewers can vote that they like or dislike a video. Each video begins with a score of 0, and the score increases by 1 for each like vote and decreases by 1 for each dislike vote. At one point Sangho saw that his video had a score of 90, and that <img alt="$65\%$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f/1/ff169c8eb4e8e515216bcd0f6f207a78af94c8b4.png" style="vertical-align: -1px; width: calc(32 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(14 * calc(1em/18));"/> of the votes cast on his video were like votes. How many votes had been cast on Sangho's video at that point?
