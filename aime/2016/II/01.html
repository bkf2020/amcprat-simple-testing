	<h2>2016 AIME II Problem 1</h2>
	<p>Initially Alex, Betty, and Charlie had a total of <img alt="$444$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/7/4/f74451609dc5de608177def4303d19339055323a.png" style="vertical-align: 0px; width: calc(27 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(12 * calc(1em/18));"/> peanuts. Charlie had the most peanuts, and Alex had the least. The three numbers of peanuts that each person had formed a geometric progression. Alex eats <img alt="$5$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/9/0/79069377f91364c2f87a64e5f9f562a091c8a6c1.png" style="width: calc(8 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(12 * calc(1em/18));"/> of his peanuts, Betty eats <img alt="$9$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/f/2/bf2c9074b396e3af0dea52d792660eea1c77f10f.png" style="width: calc(8 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(12 * calc(1em/18));"/> of her peanuts, and Charlie eats <img alt="$25$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/6/6/66644fd9f411299c3c1eabf151b5f601c9ef6c21.png" style="width: calc(17 * calc(1em/18)); max-height: calc(12 * calc(1em/18));"/> of his peanuts. Now the three numbers of peanuts each person has forms an arithmetic progression. Find the number of peanuts Alex had initially.
